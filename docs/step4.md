# Step 4: Licence plate recognition

Now that you know how the environment works, the real work can begin!

Still in you environment, just open the file `02_Licence-plate-recognition.ipynb`, and follow the instructions directly in the notebook!

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}

{: refdef}

At the end of the notebook, it will look like this:

{: refdef}

Once you're finished, you can come back here and [head to the next section.](step5.md)
