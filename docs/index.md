# Red Hat OpenShift Data Science Workshop - Licence plate recognition

## Introduction

Welcome!

In this introductory workshop, you'll learn how to use **Red Hat OpenShift Data Science** to recognize licence plates in car pictures, and extract the number from this plate.

* We'll start from an image like this:

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![alt text](./assets/img/car.png "Original car image")
{: refdef}

* Then we'll automatically recognize and extract this image:

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![alt text](./assets/img/plate.png "Extracted plate image")
{: refdef}

* From which we will recognize the plate number, **S7JDW** !

And all of this without having to install anything on your own computer, thanks to **Red Hat OpenShift Data Science**!

If you're ready,  [let's start!](step1.md)
