Consumer Complain Classification

__Good customer service__ is a cornerstone of any well-run business because, of course, without customers what have you got? Undoubtedly the most important part of providing good customer service is properly managing consumer complaints.

__Customer feedback__ can come from anywhere, not just through emails, phone calls, and chatbots. Customers leave unsolicited feedback about your products and services on social media, online forums, pretty much all over the internet. And spontaneous feedback, more often than not, is negative because that’s when customers feel most compelled to voice their opinions – when they’re unhappy.

These online complaints are only growing by the day, and they can be difficult to get a handle on. Furthermore, surveys show that __18% of customers__ who comment or complain on social media expect a response immediately, while a full 83% expect it to come the same day. And __nearly 50% of customers__ reported that they’d stopped doing business with a company due to poor customer service.

But how can you respond quickly and effectively to all these customers, coming from all corners of the internet (as well as through regular customer support channels)?

Customer complaint classification with __machine learning__ is the answer. AI-powered __text analysis__ tools can monitor customer comments – wherever they may appear – find out which are complaints, automatically route them to the right team, and analyze them for immediately actionable insights.


In this application, we use the consumer complaints dataset which contains consumer complaint narriative in 11 categories:
__'Bank account or service' 'Consumer Loan' 'Credit card'
 'Credit reporting' 'Debt collection' 'Money transfers' 'Mortgage'
 'Other financial service' 'Payday loan' 'Prepaid card' 'Student loan'__
